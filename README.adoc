= Zsh Shift Select Mode

// Enable kbd:[] macro
:experimental:
:toc: preamble

Emacs https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shift-Selection.html[shift-select mode] for Zsh – select text in the command line using kbd:[Shift] as in many text editors, browsers and other GUI programs.

This plugin does not override any existing widgets and binds only **shift**ed keys (see <<Key Bindings>>).
It creates a new `shift-select` keymap that is automatically activated when the shift selection is invoked (using any of the defined **shift**ed keys) and deactivated (the current keymap switches back to `main`) on any key that is not defined in the `shift-select` keymap.
Thanks to this approach, it does not interfere with other plugins (for example, it works with https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions[zsh-autosuggestions] without any change).

Key bindings for moving the cursor _without_ selection (e.g. kbd:[Ctrl] + arrows, kbd:[Home] etc.) are out of scope of this plugin.footnote:[You can take inspiration from https://github.com/jirutka/alpine-zsh-config/blob/master/zshrc.d/50-key-bindings.zsh[key bindings in alpine-zsh-config].]
So is synchronization with the system clipboard.footnote:[For an example, see https://github.com/jirutka/alpine-zsh-config/blob/master/zshrc.d/70-clipboard.zsh[clipboard integration in alpine-zsh-config].]

== Key Bindings

=== List of keys defined in the `emacs` and `shift-select` keymap:

* kbd:[Shift + Left Arrow] – select one character to the left
* kbd:[Shift + Right Arrow] – select one character to the right
* kbd:[Shift + Up Arrow] – select one line up
* kbd:[Shift + Down Arrow] – select one line down
* kbd:[Shift + Home] or kbd:[Shift + Ctrl + A] – select to the beginning of a line
* kbd:[Shift + End] or kbd:[Shift + Ctrl + E] – select to the end of a line
* kbd:[Shift + Ctrl + Left Arrow] ^<<macos>>^ – select to the beginning of a word
* kbd:[Shift + Ctrl + Right Arrow] ^<<macos>>^ – select to the end of a word
* kbd:[Shift + Ctrl + Home] ^<<macos>>^ – select to the beginning of an input buffer
* kbd:[Shift + Ctrl + End] ^<<macos>>^ – select to the end of an input buffer
* kbd:[Ctrl + A] – select all text in the buffer (including multi-line commands)

[[macos, ]]
_^^ The last four actions use kbd:[Shift + Option] instead of kbd:[Shift + Ctrl] on macOS._

== Editing Behavior

In addition to selection, this plugin supports common text editor behaviors:

* kbd:[Ctrl + X] – cuts the selected text (works for both shift-selected and mouse-selected text).
* Typing while text is selected with kbd:[Shift + arrows] – replaces the selected text with the typed input (instead of appending at the end of the line)



=== List of keys defined in the `shift-select` keymap only:

* kbd:[Delete] or kbd:[Backspace] – delete selected text

If you want to add custom key bindings to manipulate with active selection, define them in the `shift-select` keymap (`bindkey -M shift-select ...`).

TIP: You can use default kbd:[Alt + W] or kbd:[Ctrl + W] key bindings to copy (`copy-region-as-kill`) or cut (`backward-kill-word`) selected text to the “kill buffer”, and kbd:[Ctrl + Y] to paste (`yank`) the contents of the “kill buffer”.

== Clipboard Integration

This plugin includes optional clipboard integration that allows you to copy selected text (both shift-selected and mouse-selected) to the system clipboard using `xclip`.

=== Prerequisites

Install `xclip`:

[source, sh]
----
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install xclip

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S xclip

# Fedora
sudo dnf install xclip
----

=== Using Ctrl+Shift+C (Default)

To use kbd:[Ctrl + Shift + C] for copying, add the following to your `kitty.conf`:

[source]
----
map ctrl+shift+c send_text all \x1b[67;6u
----

This will allow you to:

* Copy shift-selected text (selected with kbd:[Shift] + arrows)
* Copy mouse-selected text
* Use kbd:[Ctrl + C] for interrupt (default behavior)

=== Using Ctrl+C for Copying (Reversed)

If you prefer to use kbd:[Ctrl + C] for copying (like in GUI applications) and kbd:[Ctrl + Shift + C] for interrupt, add the following to your `kitty.conf`:

[source]
----
# Ctrl+C sends the escape sequence for copying
map ctrl+c send_text all \x1b[67;6u

# Ctrl+Shift+C sends interrupt (default behavior)
map ctrl+shift+c send_text all \x03
----

=== Other Terminals

This approach works with any terminal emulator that supports key remapping, such as:

* *Kitty* – as shown above
* *WezTerm* – use similar key remapping in `wezterm.lua`
* *Alacritty* – use key bindings in `alacritty.yml`

NOTE: If you have any existing mapping for kbd:[Ctrl + Shift + C] in your `kitty.conf` (such as `map ctrl+shift+c copy_to_clipboard`), you must remove or comment it out first, as it will conflict with this configuration.

=== Alternative: Without Terminal Remapping

If your terminal doesn't support key remapping, you can add the following to your `$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc` (by default `~/.zshrc`) to use kbd:[Ctrl + /] for copying:

[source, sh]
----
x-copy-selection () {
  if [[ $MARK -ne $CURSOR ]]; then
    local start=$(( MARK < CURSOR ? MARK : CURSOR ))
    local length=$(( MARK > CURSOR ? MARK - CURSOR : CURSOR - MARK ))
    local selected="${BUFFER:$start:$length}"
    print -rn "$selected" | xclip -selection clipboard
  fi
}
zle -N x-copy-selection
bindkey '^_' x-copy-selection
----

You can change the keybinding to any key you prefer. For example, to use kbd:[Ctrl + K] instead:

[source, sh]
----
bindkey '^K' x-copy-selection
----

NOTE: The `^_` sequence represents kbd:[Ctrl + /] (Ctrl + Slash), and `^K` represents kbd:[Ctrl + K]. You can find other key sequences by running `cat` in your terminal and pressing the desired key combination.

TIP: The manual keybinding approach has an additional feature: if no text is selected, it will copy the entire current line to the clipboard.

== Terminals Compatibility

Some keys may not work in your terminal by default.
To find out if this is the case, run `cat` (without any arguments) in your terminal and press the key sequence in question.
If nothing is printed, it means that your terminal or operating system has intercepted the key sequence.

This plugin has been tested in the following terminals:

|===
| Terminal  | State

| Alacritty | ✔️ works out-of-box
| Kitty     | ⚙️ kbd:[Shift + Ctrl] doesn’t work out-of-box, apply <<Kitty, fix>>
| WezTerm   | ⚙️ kbd:[Shift + Ctrl + arrows] doesn’t work out-of-box, apply <<WezTerm, fix>>
|===


=== Kitty

https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/[Kitty] uses kbd:[Shift + Ctrl] as the modifier for all its shortcuts (https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/conf/#opt-kitty.kitty_mod[kitty_mod]) by default.
Add the following snippet to your `kitty.conf` to unmap the key strokes used by this plugin.

[source]
----
# Don't intercept the following key strokes to make zsh-shift-select work.
map ctrl+shift+left no_op
map ctrl+shift+right no_op
map ctrl+shift+home no_op
map ctrl+shift+end no_op
----


=== WezTerm

https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/[WezTerm] uses kbd:[Shift + Ctrl + Left Arrow] and kbd:[Shift + Ctrl + Right Arrow] to activate a pane in the left and right direction, respectively (see https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/config/default-keys.html[Default Key Assignments] in the docs).
If you want to use these keys in Zsh instead, you can disable the default assignments in your `wezterm.lua`:

[source, lua]
----
return {
  keys = {
    { key = 'LeftArrow', mods = 'CTRL|SHIFT', action = 'DisableDefaultAssignment' },
    { key = 'RightArrow', mods = 'CTRL|SHIFT', action = 'DisableDefaultAssignment' },
  },
}
----
